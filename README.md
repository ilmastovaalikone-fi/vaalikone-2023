# Kommunalwahlcheck 2020 Documentation

> A voting advice application (VAA) or election compass is a Web application that helps voters find a candidate or a party that stands closest to their preferences.

We have prepared 30 statements for the upcoming municipal elections in M√ºnster, North Rhine-Westphalia, and asked the participating parties and mayoral candidates about their positions and arguments. Almost all of them have provided comprehensive answers. Who advocates for your political views? Use our VAAs to find out. **Try it** ‚ú®
