# Kommunalwahlcheck NRW 2020

> A voting advice application (VAA) or election compass is a Web application that helps voters find a candidate or a party that stands closest to their preferences.

### Methodological summary

We prepared a questionnaire for parties and individual candidates participating in the local elections to fill out ahead of election date. **Questions** ("statements") were assembled by [Prof. Kersting's team](https://www.uni-muenster.de/IfPol/Kersting/URII/) at the University of Muenster Institute of Political Science. **Positions** were voluntarily sent in by parties and candidates upon our team's request. Depending on the degree of controversy and relevance to each district 30 out of 44* questions were selected to enter the respective *Kommunalwahlcheck* applications. 

###### Note: Some parties and/or candidates refused to participate in this project or left out some questions, thus, the data may seem incomplete. We are, nontheless, quite happy with the rate of participation and the reach our applications had among voters.<br/><br/>*47 for Münster's runoff election on 27.09.20

### Election know how
In the Federal Republic of Germany each of the 16 federal states has authority over setting the rules for local, i.e. district, elections on its territory. North Rhine-Westphalia ("NRW") applies the model of the *South German council constitution* according to which city mayors (for urban districts) and district administrators (for rural districts) are not only the highest representatives of their respective municipalities and head of the district authority. They also preside over the city or district council, respectively. They are elected by *direct ballot* as **individual candidates** while the city or district council comprises of **parties** winning seats *proportional* to their share of the public vote. Individual candidates enter a **runoff** election if no one candidate reaches the 50%+1 threshold in the 1st round.
